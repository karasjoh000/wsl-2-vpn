This is a script that got wsl 2 with vpn working for me. It seems like I ran this script once and I never seen issues again so if you have problems with VPN give this script a try. Maybe some other magical things happened and this script is completely useless which in this case this repo will be deleted whenever I find the time to reverse the changes and pinpoint the cause. Proxy injection is not needed for GlobalProtect vpn.
